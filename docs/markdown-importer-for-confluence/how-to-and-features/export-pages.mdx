## Understanding Export Results

### File Structure

When you export, you'll receive a ZIP file with the following structure:

```
confluence-export/
├── Home.md
├── Getting Started/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── Installation.md
│   └── Quick Start.md
├── Features/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── Import Features.md
│   └── Export Features.md
└── attachments/
    ├── Getting Started/
    │   ├── screenshot1.png
    │   └── diagram.png
    └── Features/
        ├── demo.gif
        └── example.pdf
```

### Attachment References

All images and attachments are referenced using relative paths:

```markdown
![Screenshot](./attachments/Getting%20Started/screenshot1.png)

[Download PDF](./attachments/Features/example.pdf)
```

### Internal Links

Internal links between pages are converted to markdown links:

```markdown
See the [Installation Guide](./Getting%20Started/Installation.md) for details.

Check out our [Features](./Features/index.md) documentation.
```

## Formatting Preservation

### Supported Confluence Elements

The exporter preserves all standard Confluence formatting:

- Bold, italic, strikethrough, underline
- Headings (H1-H6)
- Block quotes
- Horizontal rules
- Colored text (as inline HTML)

**Lists:**

- Unordered lists
- Ordered lists
- Nested lists
- Task lists with checkboxes

**Code:**

- Inline code
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Language specification preserved

**Tables:**

- Complex table structures

**Media:**

- Images with alt text
- File attachments
- Image galleries (as individual images)

**Special Elements:**

- Info, warning, note, and tip panels (as blockquotes)
- Expand/collapse sections (as standard content)
- Status labels (as text)
- User mentions (as text with @ symbol)

### Confluence-Specific Features

**Macros:**
Most Confluence macros are converted to equivalent markdown or plain text:

- Info/Warning/Note panels → Blockquotes
- Code block → Fenced code blocks
- Table of contents → Generated list
- Expand → Regular content with heading

**Page Properties:**
Optional frontmatter can include:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: John Doe
created: 2024-01-15
modified: 2024-01-20
space: DOCS
page_id: 123456789
---
```

## Export Customization

### File Naming Options

Choose how exported files are named:

- **Page titles**: Use Confluence page titles
- **Slugified names**: Convert to URL-friendly names (default)
- **Numbered**: Add sequential numbers for ordering
- **Custom prefix**: Add prefix to all files

### Folder Structure Options

**Hierarchy-based** (default): Mirrors Confluence page tree

```
Parent Page/
├── index.md
└── Child Page.md
```

**Flat structure**: All pages in one folder

```
Parent-Page.md
Child-Page.md
```

**By space**: Organize by Confluence space

```
DOCS/
  └── pages/
TEAM/
  └── pages/
```

### Attachment Handling

**By page** (default): Organize attachments by source page

```
attachments/
├── Page 1/
│   └── image.png
└── Page 2/
    └── file.pdf
```

**Flat structure**: All attachments in one folder

```
attachments/
├── image.png
└── file.pdf
```

**By type**: Group attachments by file type

```
attachments/
├── images/
│   └── image.png
└── documents/
    └── file.pdf
```

## Advanced Features

### Batch Export

Export multiple spaces or page trees in one operation:

1. Open from global access
2. Select "Batch Export" mode
3. Choose multiple spaces or parent pages
4. Configure export options
5. Export all at once
6. Receive separate ZIP files for each

### Incremental Export

Export only pages modified since last export:

1. Enable "Track exports" in settings
2. Perform initial full export
3. Subsequent exports only include:
   - New pages
   - Modified pages
   - New/updated attachments
4. Merge with previous exports manually

### Selective Export

Choose specific pages to include or exclude:

1. Start space or tree export
2. Review page list
3. Uncheck pages to exclude
4. Export selected pages only

## Export Tips & Best Practices

### Before Exporting

1. **Review content**: Ensure pages are up-to-date
2. **Check permissions**: Verify you have access to all pages
3. **Clean up**: Remove outdated or duplicate pages
4. **Organize**: Structure pages logically in Confluence

### During Export

1. **Stay online**: Maintain internet connection
2. **Keep browser open**: Don't close the tab
3. **Be patient**: Large spaces take time to process
4. **Monitor progress**: Watch for any error messages

### After Export

1. **Verify structure**: Check folder organization
2. **Test links**: Ensure internal links work
3. **Check attachments**: Verify all files are present
4. **Review formatting**: Spot-check markdown rendering

### For Best Results

1. **Export incrementally**: Start with small sections
2. **Test first**: Try single page before full space
3. **Use metadata**: Enable frontmatter for tracking
4. **Keep backups**: Store exports in version control
5. **Document structure**: Include README files

## Common Export Scenarios

### Documentation Backup

Export your Confluence spaces regularly for backup:

- Use space export for complete backups
- Schedule regular exports (weekly/monthly)
- Store in secure location
- Version your backups

### Documentation Portability

Create portable documentation that works offline:

- Export complete spaces or sections
- Host as static site (e.g., MkDocs, Jekyll)
- Share with external stakeholders
- Create customer-facing docs

### Content Migration

Move documentation to another platform:

- Export from Confluence to markdown
- Use markdown as universal format
- Import to new platform
- Verify content after migration

### Archiving Old Content

Archive completed projects or old documentation:

- Export project documentation
- Include all attachments
- Compress and store
- Document archive location

## Troubleshooting

### Export Fails

**Large exports timing out:**

- Export in smaller sections
- Use selective export to exclude unnecessary pages
- Try during off-peak hours

**Missing attachments:**

- Check attachment permissions in Confluence
- Verify files exist on pages
- Try re-uploading attachments

**Formatting issues:**

- Complex macros may not convert perfectly
- Review exported markdown
- Make manual adjustments if needed

### File Access Issues

**Permission denied:**

- Verify you have view access to all pages
- Ask space admin for necessary permissions
- Export only pages you can access

**Missing pages:**

- Check page restrictions in Confluence
- Verify pages haven't been deleted
- Ensure space access is granted

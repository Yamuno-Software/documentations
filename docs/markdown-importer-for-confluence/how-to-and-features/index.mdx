## Overview

This app provides two-way conversion between markdown and Confluence:

- **[Importing Markdown](/markdown-importer-for-confluence/how-to-and-features/importing-markdown)**: Convert markdown files to Confluence pages
- **[Export Features](/markdown-importer-for-confluence/how-to-and-features/export-pages)**: Convert Confluence pages to markdown files

---

## Importing Features

Import markdown files to Confluence — single files, multiple files, or ZIP archives without a fixed limit:

1. Navigate to any Confluence page (page-level) or open from the global Apps menu (global access)
2. Select "Markdown Importer & Exporter"
3. Choose single file, multiple files, or upload a `.zip` archive containing markdown, folders, and assets
4. Configure options as needed
5. Click "Import"

The files will be imported in the order they were selected. Large batches may take longer depending on Confluence API limits.

For detailed import instructions, see the [Importing Markdown to Confluence](/markdown-importer-for-confluence/how-to-and-features/importing-markdown) guide.

### ZIP Upload

- Upload a single `.zip` containing your markdown files
- Folder structure is preserved as a Confluence page hierarchy
- Local images and other attachments are uploaded automatically

## Preview Support

Preview your markdown files before importing:

![Preview markdown](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/product-listing/files/a8374c9b-e5da-4fe4-85a5-0ab71f285231?fileType=image&mode=full-fit)

1. Select your markdown file(s)
2. Click "Preview" instead of "Import"
3. Review how the content will look in Confluence
4. Make any necessary adjustments
5. Click "Import" when ready

## Media Handling

### Images

- Local images are uploaded as Confluence attachments
- Remote images can be fetched and stored in Confluence
- Image references are updated automatically

### Attachments

- Files referenced in markdown are uploaded as attachments
- Links to attachments are updated to point to Confluence

## File Hierarchy

- Preserve your folder structure during import
- Each folder becomes a parent page with child pages mirroring subfolders
- Works with both multi-file selection and ZIP uploads

## Access Levels

- Page-level access: open from a page’s ••• menu to import under that page
- Global access: open from the global Apps menu and target any space
- Admins can run imports across all spaces from global access

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are supported with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Tables

Markdown tables are converted to Confluence tables:

```
| Feature | Description                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Tables  | Full table support with alignment   |
| Code    | Syntax highlighting for code blocks |
| Images  | Automatic image upload and linking  |
```

## Task Lists

Convert markdown task lists to Confluence checkboxes:

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Another task

## Best Practices

1. **Backup First**: Always backup your Confluence pages before importing
2. **Test Small**: Test with a small set of files first
3. **Check Links**: Verify internal links after import
4. **Review Media**: Ensure all images and attachments are properly imported
5. **Update References**: Update any external references to the new pages

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the [Known Issues](/markdown-importer-for-confluence/known-issues) page
2. Verify your markdown syntax
3. Ensure all referenced files are accessible
4. Check your Confluence permissions
5. Contact [support](https://yamuno.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/2/create/51) if needed

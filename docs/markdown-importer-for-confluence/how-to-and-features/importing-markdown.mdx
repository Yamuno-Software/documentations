## Prerequisites

Before importing, ensure you have:

1. The necessary permissions in Confluence
2. Your markdown files organized in a logical structure
3. All referenced media files accessible

## How to Import Markdown

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to the target Confluence page (for page-level import) or open from the global Apps menu (for global access)
2. Click the ••• (More actions) menu and select "Markdown Importer & Exporter"
3. Choose single file, multiple files, or upload a `.zip` archive
4. Click "Import"

### Advanced Options

When importing, you can configure:

- **Import Order**: Files are imported in the order they were selected
- **Page Hierarchy**: Maintain your folder structure as page hierarchy
- **Metadata**: Import frontmatter as page properties
- **Media Handling**: Choose how to handle images and attachments
- **Target Space**: From global access, select one or multiple spaces
- **Scope**: Admins can import to all spaces in one operation

## Best Practices

1. **Organize Files**: Group related files together before import
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all referenced files are included
3. **Test First**: Try with a small subset before large imports
4. **Backup**: Always backup your Confluence space before importing

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

3. **Media Problems**: Check media file permissions
4. **Link Breaking**: Verify internal links before import

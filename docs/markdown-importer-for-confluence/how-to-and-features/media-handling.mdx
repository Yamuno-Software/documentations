The Markdown Importer for Confluence supports local and remote media during the import process, including when uploading a ZIP archive.

## Image Handling

### Local Images

Local images referenced by your markdown are uploaded as Confluence attachments and links are updated automatically.

### Remote Images

Remote images (from URLs) work out of the box and can optionally be mirrored into Confluence storage.

## Attachment Management

### Supported File Types

The importer handles common attachments referenced in markdown and within ZIP uploads:

- Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG)
- Archives (ZIP)
- Code files
- Other binary files supported by Confluence

### Attachment Processing

Attachments are:

1. Uploaded to Confluence during import
2. Linked correctly in the generated pages
3. Preserved with their original file names

## Best Practices

Best practices:

1. **Image Optimization**: Optimize images for faster uploads
2. **File Organization**: Maintain a clear folder structure for hierarchy
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent, descriptive file names
4. **Size Limits**: Keep files within Confluence's upload size limits

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting:

1. **Missing Images**: Ensure referenced files are included in your ZIP
2. **Upload Failures**: Check Confluence attachment size limits
3. **Broken Links**: Use relative paths consistently within your project
4. **Storage Issues**: Monitor Confluence storage for large imports

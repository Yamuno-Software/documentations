We're excited to introduce a powerful REST API that enables you to import markdown content into Confluence programmatically from external applications and CI/CD pipelines.

- **REST API Endpoint**: Import markdown content via HTTPS requests with Bearer token authentication
- **Conflict Handling**: Built-in support for overwrite mode to update existing pages or prevent duplicates

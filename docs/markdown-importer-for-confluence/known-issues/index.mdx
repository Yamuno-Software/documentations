# Known Issues & Limitations

Below is a list of current known issues and limitations for Markdown Importer for Confluence. We are actively working to resolve these and improve the experience.

## 1. Large File Imports

- **Issue:** Importing very large markdown files (over 2MB) may fail or take a long time.
- **Workaround:** Split large files into smaller sections before importing.

## 2. Unsupported Markdown Extensions

- **Issue:** Some advanced markdown extensions (e.g., custom containers, footnotes) may not render as expected.
- **Workaround:** Stick to standard markdown syntax for best results.

## 3. Image Upload Failures

- **Issue:** Occasionally, image uploads may fail due to network or Confluence API limits.
- **Workaround:** Retry the import or upload images manually if needed.

## 4. Attachment Size Limits

- **Issue:** Confluence enforces a maximum file size for attachments (typically 100MB).
- **Workaround:** Compress or split large attachments before importing.

## 5. Table Formatting

- **Issue:** Complex tables with merged cells or advanced formatting may not render perfectly.
- **Workaround:** Simplify tables or adjust formatting after import.

## 6. Task List Conversion

- **Issue:** Some markdown task lists may not convert to Confluence checkboxes correctly.
- **Workaround:** Manually adjust checkboxes after import if needed.

## 7. Link Conversion

- **Issue:** Relative links between markdown files may not always resolve correctly in Confluence.
- **Workaround:** Update links after import to ensure they point to the correct Confluence pages.

## 8. Import Performance on Very Large Batches

- **Issue:** Very large imports may take longer due to Confluence API rate limits.
- **Workaround:** Run imports during off-peak hours or split into logical groups for faster completion.

## 9. ZIP & Hierarchy Edge Cases

- **Issue:** Deeply nested directories or unusual characters in file names may cause unexpected page titles or hierarchy.
- **Workaround:** Keep folder depth reasonable and use standard ASCII characters where possible.

## 10. Space-wide Name Uniqueness

- **Issue:** Confluence requires page titles to be unique within a space. Similarly, top-level folders that map to parent pages must also have unique names within that space.
- **Workaround:** Ensure that files and folders intended to become pages have unique names per space. If duplicates exist, rename them before import or adjust the import target structure.

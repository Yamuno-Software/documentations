# Attachments

Markdown Renderer for Confluence allows you to seamlessly integrate attachments from your Confluence instance into your markdown content.

## Adding Attachments

1. Click the attachment icon in the toolbar
2. Browse your Confluence attachments
3. Select the file you want to embed
4. The attachment will be automatically inserted into your markdown

## Supported Attachment Types

- Images (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG)
- Documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX)
- Presentations (PPT, PPTX)
- And other Confluence-supported file types

## Image Attachments

### Basic Image Syntax

```
![Alt text](attachment:filename.png)
```

### Image with Title

```
![Alt text](attachment:filename.png "Image title")
```

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive alt text for images
2. Keep file sizes reasonable for better performance
3. Use the attachment picker for secure file embedding
4. Verify attachment permissions before sharing
5. Update attachment references if files are moved

## Limitations

Due to Atlassian's data egress policy:

- All attachments must be hosted within Confluence
- External file URLs cannot be used
- Files must be uploaded to Confluence before embedding

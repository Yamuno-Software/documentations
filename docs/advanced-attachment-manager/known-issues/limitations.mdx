# Limitations

This page documents the current limitations of Advanced Attachment Manager for Confluence.

## Attachment Version Size Limitation

Due to Atlassian API limitations:

- The file size shown for attachment versions is not accurate
- The displayed size is always from the latest version
- This affects all version-related features and reporting
- We have raised this issue with Atlassian and are actively discussing a solution

### Impact

- Version size comparisons may be inaccurate
- Storage calculations for older versions may be incorrect
- Bulk operations based on version size may not be precise

### Workaround

- Use the latest version size as a reference
- For precise version size information, download the specific version
- Monitor storage usage through Confluence's native tools

## Atlassian Platform Limitations

### Storage and Access

- Files must be uploaded to Confluence before they can be managed
- External storage is not supported
- Custom CSP (Content Security Policy) must be configured if loading assets from your own domain

### API Restrictions

- Rate limits apply to bulk operations
- Some operations may be slower in large instances
- Certain metadata may not be available through the API

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Verification**: Periodically verify file sizes manually
2. **Backup Important**: Keep backups of critical files
3. **Monitor Storage**: Use Confluence's native tools for storage monitoring
4. **Stay Updated**: Check release notes for new features and improvements
5. **Report Issues**: Contact support if you encounter any problems

## Future Improvements

We are actively working with Atlassian to:

- Improve version size accuracy
- Enhance API capabilities
- Add more detailed reporting features
- Implement better storage management tools

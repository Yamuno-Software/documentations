## Quick Overview

Advanced Attachment Manager for Confluence allows you to:

- View and manage all attachments in one dashboard
- Detect and clean up unused attachments
- Perform bulk actions on multiple files
- Track attachment usage and history
- Export attachment data for reporting

## Important Note

Due to Atlassian API limitations, the file size shown for attachment versions is not accurate and always reflects the latest version's size. We have raised this issue with Atlassian and are actively discussing a solution. For more details, see our [Limitations](/advanced-attachment-manager/known-issues/limitations) page.

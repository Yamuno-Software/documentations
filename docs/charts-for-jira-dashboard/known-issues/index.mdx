# Known Issues & Limitations

This page lists current known issues, limitations, and workarounds for Charts - Reports and Graphs for Jira Dashboard.

### Performance Issues

#### Large Dataset Performance

**Issue**: Charts may load slowly when processing more than 1000 issues
**Impact**: Loading times of 10+ seconds on large datasets
**Workaround**:

- Use more specific JQL filters to reduce data scope
- Limit time ranges (e.g., last 90 days instead of all time)
- Consider breaking large charts into smaller, focused ones

#### Memory Usage with Multiple Charts

**Issue**: Browser memory usage increases with multiple charts on dashboard
**Impact**: Potential browser slowdown with 10+ charts
**Workaround**:

- Limit to 8 charts per dashboard
- Use browser refresh periodically
- Close unused browser tabs

### Data Display Issues

#### Custom Field Limitations

**Issue**: Some custom field types not fully supported for grouping
**Affected Fields**:

- Multi-select custom fields
- Cascading select fields
- User picker fields with multiple users

**Workaround**: Use labels or components for grouping instead

#### JQL Timeout on Complex Queries

**Issue**: Very complex JQL queries may timeout
**Impact**: Chart fails to load with "Query timeout" error
**Workaround**:

- Simplify JQL queries
- Remove unnecessary OR conditions
- Use indexed fields in filters

#### Unicode Character Display

**Issue**: Some Unicode characters may not display correctly in chart labels
**Impact**: Non-Latin characters appear as squares or question marks
**Workaround**: Use ASCII characters in field values where possible

### Chart-Specific Issues

#### Pie Chart Slice Limit

**Issue**: Pie charts become unreadable with more than 8 slices
**Impact**: Small slices are difficult to distinguish
**Workaround**:

- Group smaller categories into "Others"
- Use bar charts for more than 8 categories
- Apply JQL filters to reduce categories

#### Line Chart Date Formatting

**Issue**: Date labels may overlap on line charts with many data points
**Impact**: X-axis labels become unreadable
**Workaround**:

- Use shorter time periods
- Enable label rotation in settings
- Switch to area chart for better spacing

#### Scatter Plot Color Mapping

**Issue**: Color mapping not available for third dimension in scatter plots
**Impact**: Limited visual differentiation of data points
**Workaround**: Use different chart types for multi-dimensional data

### Dashboard Integration

#### Gadget Sizing Constraints

**Issue**: Chart gadgets have minimum size restrictions
**Impact**: Charts may not fit well in small dashboard spaces
**Workaround**:

- Use recommended gadget sizes
- Create separate dashboards for different chart sizes
- Use table view for compact displays

### Permission & Access Issues

#### Cross-Project Permissions

**Issue**: Users may see empty charts if lacking permissions for some projects
**Impact**: Incomplete data visualization without clear error indication
**Workaround**:

- Verify project permissions before creating charts
- Use project-specific dashboards
- Add permission checks to JQL queries

#### Shared Dashboard Access

**Issue**: Shared dashboards may not work correctly for users with different permissions
**Impact**: Inconsistent chart data between users
**Workaround**:

- Use role-based dashboard sharing
- Create permission-specific chart versions
- Document required permissions for each chart

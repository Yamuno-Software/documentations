## Usage Questions

### How do I add a LaTeX equation?

**Quick Method:**
1. Edit a Confluence page
2. Type `/latex`
3. Select the macro
4. Enter your LaTeX equation
5. Save

See [Quick Start Guide](/latex-math-for-confluence/getting-started) for more details.

### What's the difference between inline and block macros?

**Inline Macro:**
- Appears within text
- Flows with paragraphs
- For simple equations
- Example: The formula $E = mc^2$ in a sentence

**Block Macro:**
- Standalone display
- Centered on page
- For complex equations
- See [Block Macro Guide](/latex-math-for-confluence/features/block-macro)

### Can I use standard LaTeX syntax?

Yes! We support standard LaTeX math syntax including:
- `$...$` for inline math
- `$$...$$` for display math
- `\[...\]` for display math
- `\(...\)` for inline math
- Standard LaTeX environments (equation, align, matrix, etc.)

### What LaTeX packages are supported?

We use **KaTeX** for rendering, which supports:
- Most standard LaTeX math commands
- Common symbols and operators
- Matrices and arrays
- Aligned equations
- Fractions, roots, integrals, sums

Not supported:
- TikZ/PGF graphics
- Custom packages
- Non-math LaTeX

See [KaTeX Supported Functions](https://katex.org/supported.html) for a complete list.

## Permissions & Security

### Who can view LaTeX equations?

Anyone with permission to view the Confluence page can see the rendered equations. View access cannot be restricted separately.

### Who can edit LaTeX equations?

This depends on your [Access Control](/latex-math-for-confluence/configuration/access-control) settings:
- **Allow All Mode:** Anyone with page edit permission
- **Restricted Mode:** Only whitelisted users
- **Admins:** Always have access

### How do I restrict editing?

1. Go to app configuration
2. Navigate to Permissions tab
3. Enable "Restrict edit access"
4. Add users to whitelist
5. Save changes

See [Access Control Guide](/latex-math-for-confluence/configuration/access-control).

### Can I use groups instead of individual users?

Group-based permissions are coming in a future update. Currently, you must add users individually to the whitelist.

### What happens if someone without permission tries to edit?

They will see an "Access Denied" message and won't be able to open the editor. The equation will render normally for viewing.

---

## Technical Questions

### Does this work offline?

No, LaTeX Math for Confluence requires an internet connection to:
- Load the editor
- Render equations
- Save changes

### Will equations show in exports?

**PDF Export:** ✅ Yes, equations render in exported PDFs

**Word Export:** ⚠️ Equations may show as images or plain text depending on Confluence's export method

**HTML Export:** ✅ Yes, equations render correctly

### Does it work on mobile?

**Viewing:** ✅ Yes, equations render perfectly on mobile devices

**Editing:** ✅ Yes, the editor works on tablets and phones with responsive interface

### What browsers are supported?

- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Is there a limit on equation size?

**Practical Limits:**
- Up to 500 lines of LaTeX code
- Matrices up to 20×20
- No hard limits, but very large equations may render slowly

### Can I use color in equations?

Yes! Use LaTeX color commands:
```latex
\textcolor{red}{x} + \textcolor{blue}{y}
```

### Does it support chemical equations?

Yes, basic chemical notation is supported through LaTeX commands like `\ce{}`.

## Performance Questions

### Will many equations slow down my pages?

LaTeX Math is optimized for performance:
- ⚡ Fast rendering with KaTeX
- 💾 Efficient caching
- 🚀 Minimal impact on page load

Typical pages with 10-20 equations load normally. Pages with 50+ equations may have slightly slower load times.

### How can I improve performance?

1. **Keep equations simple** - Avoid unnecessary complexity
2. **Use appropriate macro types** - Inline for simple, block for complex
3. **Limit per page** - Consider 20-30 equations as a soft maximum
4. **Optimize content** - Remove unused or duplicate equations

---

## Troubleshooting

### My equation won't render

**Common causes:**
1. **Syntax error** - Check for missing braces, typos
2. **Unsupported command** - Verify command is KaTeX-compatible
3. **Browser issue** - Try refreshing or different browser
4. **Cache problem** - Clear browser cache

**Solution:** Use the live preview to identify and fix errors.

### I see "Access Denied" when editing

**Cause:** You're not in the whitelist

**Solutions:**
1. Ask admin to add you to whitelist
2. Check if restricted mode is enabled
3. Verify you're logged in correctly

See [Access Control & Permissions](/latex-math-for-confluence/configuration/access-control).

### The editor won't open

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Try incognito mode** to rule out extensions
4. **Verify app is enabled** in Manage Apps
5. **Contact support** if issue persists

### Equations look different on mobile

**This is normal.** Equations may scale slightly differently on mobile to fit the screen. They remain readable and functional.

## Migration Questions

### Can I import equations from other LaTeX apps?

**Migration feature coming soon!**

Currently:
- Manual copy/paste of LaTeX code works
- Export from old app, import to new macro

Future:
- Automated migration tools
- Bulk import
- Format conversion

See [Migration Guide](/latex-math-for-confluence/migration) for updates.

### How do I migrate from another LaTeX app?

**Current process:**
1. Copy LaTeX code from old macro
2. Insert new LaTeX Math macro
3. Paste code
4. Verify rendering
5. Delete old macro

### What happens to old equations if I uninstall?

**Warning:** Uninstalling removes the app but leaves placeholder macros on your pages. Equations will not render.

**Before uninstalling:**
- Export important pages
- Consider migration to another app
- Back up LaTeX code if needed

## Best Practices

### When should I use inline vs block macros?

**Use Inline for:**
- Variables in sentences
- Simple formulas
- Inline notation
- Text-integrated equations

**Use Block for:**
- Important equations
- Complex formulas
- Multi-line expressions
- Equations needing emphasis

### How many equations should I put on one page?

**Recommendations:**
- **Optimal:** 10-20 equations per page
- **Acceptable:** Up to 50 equations
- **Avoid:** More than 50 (consider splitting)

### Should I use delimiters?

It's optional! The macros work with or without delimiters:
- With delimiters: More portable to other LaTeX tools
- Without: Simpler, cleaner code

Choose based on your needs.

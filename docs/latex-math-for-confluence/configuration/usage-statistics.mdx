# Usage Statistics

View which pages and spaces are using LaTeX macros in your Confluence instance.

## Overview

Usage Statistics shows you where LaTeX Math macros are being used across your Confluence instance. This helps you track adoption and find pages with mathematical equations.

2. Scan the list of pages
3. Look for the page title or space you need
4. Click **"View Page"** to open it

### Monitor Adoption

**Track usage across spaces:**
- See which spaces are using LaTeX macros
- Identify teams actively using mathematical equations
- Understand adoption across your organization

### Navigate to Content

**Quick access:**
- Click the **"View Page"** button next to any page
- Opens the page in a new tab
- Navigate directly to pages with equations

## Page List Details

### Information Displayed

For each page, you'll see:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Page Title** | The name of the Confluence page |
| **Space** | The space where the page is located |
| **Actions** | Button to view the page |

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Finding Mathematical Content

**Scenario:** You need to find all documentation with equations

**Steps:**
1. Open Usage Statistics
2. Review the list of pages
3. Click through pages in relevant spaces
4. Locate the content you need

---

### Use Case 2: Tracking Adoption

**Scenario:** You want to see which teams are using LaTeX

**Steps:**
1. Open Usage Statistics
2. Look at which spaces have pages listed
3. Identify active teams
4. Reach out to teams not yet using the feature

---

### Use Case 3: Content Audit

**Scenario:** You need to review all mathematical content

**Steps:**
1. Open Usage Statistics
2. Export or note down all pages (manually)
3. Visit each page to review content
4. Update or maintain equations as needed

---

## Best Practices

### Regular Reviews

1. **Check usage periodically** - See adoption trends
2. **Visit listed pages** - Ensure equations are correct
3. **Monitor new pages** - Track when teams start using LaTeX
4. **Document usage patterns** - Note which spaces use equations most

### Content Management

1. **Review equations regularly** - Keep content accurate
2. **Update outdated content** - Maintain mathematical accuracy
3. **Archive unused pages** - Clean up old content
4. **Train new users** - Help teams adopt LaTeX macros

## Limitations

### What's NOT Tracked

Currently, usage statistics **do not** include:
- ❌ Number of macros per page
- ❌ Macro types (inline vs block)
- ❌ Creation dates
- ❌ Last modified dates
- ❌ User who created macros
- ❌ Edit history
- ❌ Usage trends over time
- ❌ Export functionality

The feature simply lists pages and spaces where macros are present.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- 📊 **Macro counts** - Number of equations per page
- 📈 **Usage trends** - Track adoption over time
- 📁 **Export to CSV** - Download usage reports
- 🔍 **Search and filter** - Find specific pages
- 👤 **User information** - See who created macros
- 📅 **Date tracking** - When macros were added
- 📊 **Analytics dashboard** - Visual charts and graphs

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Pages Listed

**Problem:** Usage statistics shows empty or no results

**Possible causes:**
1. No LaTeX macros have been added yet
2. Macros were recently deleted
3. App needs to refresh

**Solutions:**
1. Add LaTeX macros to some pages
2. Wait a few minutes for the list to update
3. Refresh the configuration page
4. Contact support if issue persists

### Can't View Page

**Problem:** "View Page" button doesn't work

**Possible causes:**
1. Page was deleted
2. You don't have view permission
3. Space permissions changed

**Solutions:**
1. Check if page still exists
2. Verify you have space access
3. Ask admin to grant permissions
4. The page may have been archived

### Statistics Not Updating

**Problem:** New pages with macros don't appear

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page** - Reload the config page
2. **Wait a moment** - Updates may take a minute
3. **Verify macro was saved** - Check the page has a LaTeX macro
4. **Contact support** - If updates don't appear after 5 minutes

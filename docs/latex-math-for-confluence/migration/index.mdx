## Manual Migration Process

### Overview

The manual migration process involves:
1. Identifying pages with old LaTeX macros
2. Extracting LaTeX code
3. Creating new LaTeX Math macros
4. Verifying rendering
5. Removing old macros

**Time estimate:** 2-5 minutes per page

---

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Identify Pages

**Find pages with LaTeX equations:**

1. Go to **Confluence Search**
2. Search for your old macro name (e.g., "math-text")
3. Note pages that need migration
4. Create a migration checklist

**Or use CQL:**
```cql
macro = "your-old-macro-name"
```

---

### Step 2: Backup Content

**Before migrating:**

1. **Export pages** as PDF or HTML backup
2. **Document LaTeX code** in a spreadsheet
3. **Take screenshots** for reference
4. **Communicate to team** about migration

> **💡 Tip:** Always backup before making changes!

---

### Step 3: Extract LaTeX Code

**Method 1: Edit Mode**
1. Open page in edit mode
2. Click on old macro
3. Copy the LaTeX code
4. Save code in a text file

**Method 2: View Source**
1. View page source
2. Find macro definition
3. Extract LaTeX content
4. Clean up any formatting

---

### Step 4: Create New Macro

1. **Insert new LaTeX Math macro**
   - Type `/latex`
   - Select appropriate type (inline/block)

2. **Paste LaTeX code**
   - Paste extracted code
   - Verify in live preview

3. **Adjust if needed**
   - Fix any syntax differences
   - Test different delimiters
   - Set alignment (block macros)

4. **Save the macro**

---

### Step 5: Verify Rendering

**Check that equation:**
- ✅ Renders correctly
- ✅ Matches original appearance
- ✅ Displays properly on mobile
- ✅ Works in dark mode
- ✅ Shows in preview and published view

---

### Step 6: Remove Old Macro

**Only after verifying:**
1. Delete old macro
2. Save page
3. Test published page
4. Mark as migrated in checklist

---

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Page

**Simple migration:**
1. Edit page
2. Replace old macro with new
3. Verify and save
4. Done! ✅

**Time:** 5 minutes

---

### Scenario 2: Multiple Pages (Same Space)

**Batch approach:**
1. List all pages in space
2. Migrate one at a time
3. Track progress
4. Verify at end

**Time:** 5 minutes × number of pages

---

### Scenario 3: Instance-Wide Migration

**Systematic approach:**
1. **Plan:**
   - Identify all affected pages
   - Prioritize critical content
   - Schedule migration windows

2. **Execute:**
   - Migrate space by space
   - Test thoroughly
   - Communicate progress

3. **Validate:**
   - Verify all pages
   - Check for issues
   - Get user feedback

**Time:** Varies by instance size

---

## Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: Syntax Differences

**Problem:** LaTeX code doesn't work in new app

**Causes:**
- Different supported commands
- Delimiter differences
- Environment variations

**Solutions:**
1. Check [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/supported.html)
2. Use live preview to debug
3. Adjust syntax as needed
4. Contact support if stuck

---

### Issue 2: Appearance Changes

**Problem:** Equation looks different

**Causes:**
- Different rendering engine
- Font differences
- Size/spacing variations

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust LaTeX formatting
2. Use sizing commands (`\large`, `\small`)
3. Test different approaches
4. Accept minor visual differences

---

### Issue 3: Unsupported Features

**Problem:** Some features don't work

**Causes:**
- Old app had custom features
- Unsupported LaTeX commands
- App-specific syntax

**Solutions:**
1. Find equivalent LaTeX commands
2. Simplify complex equations
3. Split into multiple macros
4. Request feature if needed

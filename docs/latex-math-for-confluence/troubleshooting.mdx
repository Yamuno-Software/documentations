## Rendering Issues

### Equation Not Displaying

**Symptoms:**
- Equation shows as blank space
- No visible output
- Placeholder appears instead

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for syntax errors**
   ```latex
   ❌ \frac{1}{2  (missing closing brace)
   ✅ \frac{1}{2}
   ```

2. **Verify delimiters**
   ```latex
   ❌ $E = mc^2  (missing closing $)
   ✅ $E = mc^2$
   ```

3. **Test simple equation**
   ```latex
   E = mc^2
   ```
   If this works, your original equation has an error

4. **Check live preview**
   - Open editor
   - Look for error messages
   - Fix indicated issues
